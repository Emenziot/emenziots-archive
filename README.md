The goal of this project is to create a DM companion application for D&D. Specifcally, I was wanting a way to track the various people, places and things that I put in my world that was easy to access and organized enough to be able to use efficiently. 

I am currently in the process of gathering the intended requirements for such an application. I know what I want on it, but I still need to organize my thoughts in a way I can program them, as well as get the input of others on what would be good features. The current plan is to have two main aspects, the Library and the Atlas. The Library would be where the bulk of the information is stored. The names, history, and important facts would be placed here. Entries in the Library that are located in a specific place would have a link to the Atlas. The Atlas would be an interactive map able to zoom from city to global scale, with particular points linked to entries in the Library.

I am still looking for input on what desireable features would be so that I can get everything organized before I begin.
